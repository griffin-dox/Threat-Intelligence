Dmitry Bestuzhev, The BlackBerry Research &amp; Intelligence Team
Summary
BlackBerry has uncovered a previously unknown threat actor targeting an aerospace organization in
the United States, with the apparent goal of conducting commercial and competitive cyber espionage.
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team is tracking this threat actor as AeroBlade. The
actor used spear-phishing as a delivery mechanism: A weaponized document, sent as an email
attachment, contains an embedded remote template injection technique and a malicious VBA macro
code, to deliver the next stage to the final payload execution.
Evidence suggests that the attackers network infrastructure and weaponization became operational
around September 2022. BlackBerry assesses with medium to high confidence that the offensive
phase of the attack occurred in July 2023. The attacker improved its toolset during that time, making it
stealthier, while the network infrastructure remained the same.
Given the final payload functionality and the subject of the attack, BlackBerry assesses with medium
to high confidence that the goal of this attack was commercial cyber espionage.

Technical Analysis
Context
The BlackBerry Threat Research and Intelligence team recently uncovered two campaigns by a
previously unknown threat actor, which we have named AeroBlade, targeting an aerospace industry
company in the U.S. We found two phases of the attack chain. The initial attack was conducted in
September 2022, and based on our technical analysis, we have concluded this was a testing stage.
The second attack occurred in July 2023.
There are certain similarities between both campaigns:
Both lure documents were named [redacted].docx.
The final payload is a reverse shell.
The command-and-control (C2) server IP address is the same.
There are also some interesting differences between the two campaigns:
The final payload of the 2023 attack is stealthier and uses more obfuscation and anti-analysis
techniques.
The 2023 campaign&
During an attack, a malicious Microsoft Word document called [redacted].docx is delivered via email
spear-phishing, which, when executed manually by the user, employs a remote template injection to
download a second stage file called [redacted].dotm. This file in turn executes &quot;item3.xml&quot;, which
creates a reverse shell connecting to &quot;redacted[.]redacted[.]com&quot; over port 443.

Attack Vector
First Stage
The first stage of the infection is a targeted email that has a malicious document attachment with the
filename [redacted].docx. When opened, the document displays text in a deliberately scrambled font,
along with a lure message asking the potential victim to click it to enable the content in MS Office.
The docx document employs remote template injection, MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique T1221, to
download the second stage of the infection.
3/13
Figure 2  The malicious document displays text in a scrambled font, along with a visual lure asking
the user to click it to enable content
Figure 3  The fixed document that appears once the victim clicks the lure message to manually
enable content
The next-stage information is saved in an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) file inside a .dotm file.
A .dotm file is a document template created by Microsoft Word, containing the default layout, settings,
and macros for a document.
Figure 4  Next stage parameter in the OLE file
hxxp://[redacted].106.27. [redacted]/[redacted][.]dotm
Once the victim opens the file and executes it by manually clicking the Enable Content lure
message, the [redacted].dotm document discretely drops a new file to the system, and opens it. The
newly downloaded document is readable, leading the victim to believe that the file initially received by
email is legitimate. In fact, its a classic cyber bait-and-switch, performed invisibly right under the
victims nose.

Figure 5  A second document is discretely downloaded and opened in place of the original
malicious document
Its interesting to note that the body of the first-stage document contains an executable library that
runs with the help of the second stage  well take a closer look at this executable library a little later
on in this report.
Figure 6  Location of the executable library in the file list in the [redacted].docx document
Second Stage
The second stage of execution is the OLE document which contains the macro. The macro runs the
library included in the first-stage document.
5/13
Figure 7  A macro that runs a malicious PE file
The second-stage macro also copies the OLE document ([redacted].docx) to a hard-coded file name
at a specific path:
C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\[redacted].zip
The final execution stage will be an executable file run on the system using the macro.
Payload
The final payload is a DLL that acts as a reverse shell that connects to a hard-coded C2 server.
Reverse shells allow attackers to open ports to the target machines, forcing communication and
enabling a complete takeover of the device. It is therefore a severe security threat.
The DLL is also capable of listing all directories found on the now-infected system. It is a heavily
obfuscated executable which implements complex techniques, such as:
Anti-disassembly techniques to make analysis harder
API hashing to hide its usage of Windows functions; The hash function used is Murmur.
Custom encoding for each string used
Multiple checks are implemented to avoid the malware running on an automated environment
such as a sandbox; This impedes analysis.
For anti-disassembly, the executable contains control flow obfuscation, usage of data between code,
and dead code-executed instructions that do not affect the malware. Dead code is a section in the
source code of a program which is executed, but whose result is never used in any other computation.
These techniques are all added to make analysis harder for defenders.
6/13
Figure 8  Example of data between code, control flow obfuscation, and use of dead code
Figure 9  Usage of evil byte, a common technique to defeat the way disassembler tools work
Figure 10  Fixed evil byte showing real code execution
The executable also implements techniques that causes the malware to skip execution on automated
systems, such as sandboxes or antivirus (AV) emulators. These techniques include:
Comparing the position of the mouse cursor using the GetCursorPos() function
Comparing time elapsed on execution using the function GetTickCount()
Checking to see if the number of processors is less than two, using the NumberOfProcessors
from the Process Environment Block (PEB) structure
Checking physical memory size using the function GlobalMemoryStatusEx()
Figure 11  Checking number of processors used by the victims machine
7/13
Figure 12  Checking available physical memory on the victims machine
After passing all those checks, the malicious DLL executes the following sequence:
Decrypts embedded static configuration containing the C2 server information for it to connect to
Collects system information from the infected machine
Sets persistence to survive upon system reboot
Finally, it connects to the C2 server, transmitting all its collected information, and spawning a
reverse shell, while also sending a list of directories found on the infected system.
Figure 13  Static configuration
Static configuration is AES encrypted, and once decrypted, contains the following structure:
First DWORD: 0x154, unknown usage, static config size is hard-coded at 72 bytes
Second DWORD: 0x1BB, connects to TCP port 443
16-byte string Pa$$w0rd seems to be a password to connect to the C2, but it is not used in
practice
C2 server points to: redacted[.]redacted[.]com
8/13
Figure 14  Example of information collected from infected system
Bot-collected data structure is as follows:
Offset 0x3: hard-coded unknown 16 bytes computed by custom unknown encode functions
Offset 0x13: username using function GetUserNameA()
Offset 0x43: computer name using function GetComputerNameA()
Offset 0x73: file name being executed using function GetModuleFileNameA()
Offset 0x178: IPV4 addresses using function GetAdaptersInfo()
Offset0x1b8: MAC addresses using function GetAdaptersInfo()
Persistence is achieved via Windows Task Scheduler, where a task named WinUpdate2 is created
to run every day at 10:10 AM. Task Scheduler functions are abused by using its COM object via the
CoCreateInstance() function.
9/13
Figure 15  Persistence is established through Windows Task Scheduler
Reverse Shell
Finally, the reverse shell is executed in a stealthy way. First, it gets the default standard handle by
calling GetStdHandle(), then the ComSpec variable is retrieved using the GetEnvironmentVariableW()
function, which by default is set to C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe. After that, a pipe is created
using CreatePipe(), and CreateProcessW() is executed, creating cmd.exe.
Figure 16  cmd.exe CreateProcess
Besides the reverse shell, the final payload can collect a complete list of directories on the victims
system by using the function GetLogicalDeviceStringsW(), looping through the list of files using
FindFirstFileA()/FindNextFileA(), and then comparing with .. to see if a given file is actually a
directory.
Figure 17  String comparison with directories
During our investigations, we found two samples from mid-2022: &quot;5[redacted sha-256]7&quot; and
&quot;5[redacted sha-256]8&quot;, which is also a reverse shell with a hard-coded C2 at &quot;[redacted][.]165&quot;
the same IP address that the C2 server from the 2023 samples are pointing to. Both samples were
10/13
targeting the aerospace industry.
While the 2022 samples are obfuscated, unlike the 2023 samples, they do not contain stealthier
functions such as API hashing, anti-analysis techniques, or encrypted static configuration. They also
dont include the capability to list directories, nor are they able to send information to a remote server.

Targets and Attribution
Based on the content of the lure message, an aerospace company in the United States was the
intended target for both campaigns.
The development of this threat group&
one year. Exactly who is behind these two campaigns remains unknown.
Conclusions
Given the relatively sophisticated technical capabilities this threat actor deployed and the victim&
timelines, we conclude with a high degree of confidence that this was a commercial cyberespionage
campaign. Its purpose was most likely to gain visibility over the internal resources of its target in order
to weigh its susceptibility to a future ransom demand.
Based on the threat actors operations timelines  September 2022 and then July 2023  we can
surmise that this shows the groups interest in the target remained consistent between the first and
second campaign, as evidenced by the increased complexity of the second campaign compared to
the first. During the time that elapsed between the two campaigns we observed, the threat actor put
considerable effort into developing additional resources to ensure they could secure access to the
sought-after information, and that they could exfiltrate it successfully.
